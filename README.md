# Book Travels

*Book Travels* is an app that visualises which geographical areas in the world are included in your reading list. 
It was born out of the desire to track my progress, after setting the goal for myself to read a book by a writer from every country in the world. 

## How to run the project

The app has a Node.js backend and a React Native frontend.
